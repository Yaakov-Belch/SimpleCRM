## Responsive design best practices

- **Standard Breakpoints**: Consistently use standard breakpoints across the application (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Fluid Layouts**: Use percentage-based widths and flexible containers that adapt to screen size
- **Relative Units**: Prefer rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility
- **Test Across Devices**: Test and verify UI changes across multiple screen sizes from mobile to tablet to desktop screen sizes and ensure a balanced, user-friendly viewing and reading experience on all
- **Readable Typography**: Maintain readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring zoom
- **Content Priority**: Show the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions
